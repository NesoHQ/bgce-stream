   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

## Development Setup

### Backend (Go)
- **Go version**: 1.19 or higher
- **Setup**:
  ```bash
  cd backend
  go mod tidy
  go run ./cmd/server
  ```
- **Testing**: `go test ./...`

### Frontend
- **Location**: `frontend/public/`
- **Approach**: Static pages with vanilla JavaScript
- **Development**: Simple HTTP server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or `npx serve`)

### General Guidelines
- Keep code small and readable
- Avoid large frameworks unless discussed with maintainers
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions

## Coding Guidelines

### General Principles
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Write code that is easy to understand
- **Small modules**: Break functionality into focused, testable units
- **Consistent style**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- **Documentation**: Add comments for non-obvious logic

### Language-Specific Guidelines

#### Go
- Follow `gofmt` formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add error handling for all operations

#### JavaScript
- Use modern ES6+ features
- Prefer `const` and `let` over `var`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

### API Guidelines
- **Backward compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes without discussion
- **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for API changes
- **Documentation**: Keep API docs up to date

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
feat(api): add room creation endpoint
fix(websocket): handle connection drops gracefully
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Best Practices
- Use imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Reference Issues: `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456`
- Be descriptive but concise
