# Roadmap: BGCE Stream MVP & Beyond

## Overview
- **MVP Goal**: Launch a working prototype to validate seamless music streaming for communities
- **Launch Timeline**: Q1 2024
- **Success Metrics**: 1000+ streams, 90% user retention

## Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW Method)
Use this table to triage features. Focus on Must-Haves for MVP.

| Priority | Feature Name | Description | Status | Est. Effort (Story Points) | Dependencies |
|----------|--------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------|--------------|
| **Must-Have (MVP Core)** | One-Click Room Creation | Instant room creation with unique, shareable links. Why: Enables immediate community audio streaming without setup friction. | ✅ Implemented | 5 | None |
| **Must-Have (MVP Core)** | WebRTC P2P Audio | Direct peer-to-peer audio streaming with <200ms latency. Essential for real-time music collaboration. | ✅ Implemented | 8 | Room Creation |
| **Must-Have (MVP Core)** | Browser Audio Processing | Native AGC, noise suppression, and music mode controls. Why: Essential for quality audio without external software. | ✅ Implemented | 6 | WebRTC |
| **Should-Have (Post-MVP)** | Room Persistence | Short TTL persistence to prevent accidental room loss. Enhances user experience. | 🔄 In Progress | 3 | Room Creation |
| **Should-Have (Post-MVP)** | Basic Moderation | Mute/kick users and room access controls. Important for community management. | 📋 Planned | 5 | Room Management |
| **Could-Have (Nice-to-Have)** | Client-Side Recording | Browser-based recording using MediaRecorder API. Nice-to-have for content creation. | 📋 Planned | 4 | WebRTC |
| **Could-Have (Nice-to-Have)** | Mobile Optimization | Enhanced mobile browser support and responsive design. | 📋 Planned | 6 | Frontend |
| **Won't-Have (Out of Scope)** | SFU Integration | Selective Forwarding Unit for >5 users. Too complex for v1, planned for v0.3. | 🔮 Future | 13 | Infrastructure |
